# What is Escape Arena

Escape Arena is an escape room based in Toronto being built by a friend. I am consulting for the company and my first project was to build a dyanmic soundboard to notify the amount of time participants have left in the game. 

There are cue's that can be selected (5 minutes left, 10 minutes left, etc), and you can select any length of time for the room to be (harder rooms can be alloted more time). 

One thing I'd like to add in the future is live feedback for raspberry pi traps we've set up in the arena. The cue cooresponding to this is titled "blackout" to signify 1 minute left in the game, but this is a (hopefully) temporary placeholder. 

Note: the text below is the generated README from the Vite development server (React, Javascript)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
